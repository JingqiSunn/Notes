#### SHA-256

**Full Name**

Secure Hash Algorithm 256 Bits

**More Information**

- A member of the SHA-2 family
- The output is a hash of 256 in length
- The input massage length should be less then $2^{128}$ bits

**The General Steps**

- Padding Bits
- Padding Length
- Initialising the Buffers
- Compression Functions

**Padding Bits**

You will add some bits to the original input to make it a multiple of 64 bits, The first adding bits will be one and the rest will be valued as  zero.

Here is an example:

â€‹	If you have a original input of 60 bits. Then you will have to pad the bits with the sequence 1000.

**Padding Length**

This step is very similar to the former step.
