###### proposition

**Proposition**

*Definition: Proposition asserts that something is the case or it asserts that something is not.*

Basic Characteristic: Every proposition is either true or false.

**What is not a Proposition**

1. Command
2. Exclamation
3. Question

**Statement & Proposition**

They are very similar but not the same thing.

**Some Important Regularities**

1. Proposition in different languages can have the same meaning.
2. The deferent sequence of the sentence parts may not change the meaning of the proposition.
3. The same proposition may have different meaning when the time is changed.

**The Classification of Proposition**

1. Simple Proposition(very simple)
2. Compound Proposition

**Compound Proposition**

1. Conjunctive Proposition

   *Definition: It will contain other propositions within themselves, and these propositions are linked by AND.*

   Characteristic: Asserting a conjunctive proposition is equivalent to asserting each of its component propositions separately.

   > The Amazon Basin produces roughly 20 percent of the Earth's oxygen, creates much of its own rainfall, and harbors many unknown species.

2. Disjunctive Proposition(Alternative proposition)

   Notation: What we are mentioning here is the inclusive type.

   *Definition: It will contain other propositions within themselves, and these propositions are linked by OR*

   Characteristic: The proposition can be plainly true just when either one of the simple proposition it takes is true.

   > Circuit courts are useful, or they are not useful.

3. Hypothetical Proposition(Conditional Proposition)

   *Definition: It will contain other propositions within themselves, and these propositions are linked by IF-THEN.*

   Characteristic: The proposition "If P, then Q." will only be false when the proposition P is true and the proposition Q is false, and the compound statement might be true even if both of its components are false.

   > If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.

###### Arguments

The Building blocks of arguments are propositions.

**What is Argument**

- Arguments are the chief concern of logic.
- Argument is a technical tern in logic.

**The Structure of Argument**

1. Premise
2. Conclusion

> [!TIP]
>
> The Conclusion can precede the statement of premises

> A record that promises to endure for all time was attained on Navin Field today when Babe ruth smashed his seven-hundredth home run in a lifetime career. It promises to live, first because few players in history have enjoyed the longevity on the diamond of the immortal Bambino, and, second, because only two other players on the history of baseball have hit more than 300 home runs.

> Every law is an evil, for every law is an infraction of liberty.

**Premise**

*Definition: Premises are the propositions that are affirmed as providing support for the conclusion.*

**Conclusion**

*Definition: The conclusion of a argument is the proposition that is affirmed on the basis of other proposition of the argument.*

**Caution**

- The premises and conclusion must show up in the same sentence.

> No one was present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.

- No single proposition can be an argument.

###### Biography

The most important people are Aristotle and Chrysippus.

##### Section 3: Recognizing Arguments

**Conclusion Indicator**

*Definition: A word or phrase appearing in an argument and usually indicating that what follows it is the conclusion of that argument.*

| Conclusion Indicator |             Explanation             |
| :------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
|      Therefore       |          For these reasons          |
|        hence         |           It follows that           |
|          So          |           I conclude that           |
|     Accordingly      |          which shows that           |
|    In Consequence    |          Which means that           |
|     Consequently     |         Which entails that          |
|     Proves that      |         Which implies that          |
|     As a result      |    Which allow us to infer that     |
|   For this reason    | Which points to the conclusion that |
|         Thus         |            We may infer             |

**Premise Indicator**

| Premise Indicator |     Explanation      |

|    Inasmuch as    | In view of fact that |

###### Arguments in Context

You have to understand their whole meanings.

###### Premises or Conclusion Not in Declarative Form

The sentence may be interrogative even though its meaning is declarative.

**Rhetorical Question**

*Definition: An utterance used to make a statement, but which, because it is in interrogative form and is therefore neither true or false, doesn't literally assert anything.*

> [!TIP]
>
> Questions can serve most effectively as premises when the answers assumed really do seem to be clear and inescapable.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Arguments that depend on rhetorical questions are always suspect, that is because the questions is neither true or false.
>
> Like the example below, the question here can be both true or false, because he didn't give any evidence standing for his opinion.
>
> > Is it possible that Arab leaders are more interested in attacking Israel than protecting religious and cultural monuments?

**Some Change in the Words make it into a Proposition**

|                       Initial Version                        |                        Final Version                         |        Type         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------: |

| If a right to euthanasia is grounded in self-determination, it cannot reasonably be limited to the terminally ill. If people have a right to die, why must they wait until they are actually dying before they are permitted to exercise that right? | If a right to euthanasia is grounded in self-determination, it cannot reasonably be limited to the terminally ill. If people have a right to die, they don't need to wait until they are actually dying before they are permitted to exercise that right. | Rhetorical Question |
