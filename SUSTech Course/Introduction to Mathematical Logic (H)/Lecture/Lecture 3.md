**Function**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> *Definition:*
>
> A function from set X to set Y
>
> 1. any x, exist y;
> 2. any x, only one y;

Notation:  $f:A\rightarrow B$

codomain: all possible output

Usually use $f(x)=y$ to denote $<x,y>\in f$

**n-ary Function**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> *Definition:*
>
> The domain of the function is a n layered Cartesian product.

**Property of Functions**

Injective: one to one

*Definition: If each element of the codomain is mapped to by at most one element of the domain.*

Surjective: onto, cover the codomain

*Definition: If each element of the codomain is mapped to by at least one element of the domain.*

Bijective: perfect, both injective and surjective

*Definition:  if each element of the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element of the domain.*

**Composite Function**

$f:x\rightarrow y,~g:y\rightarrow z.$

Then we have $f\circ g:x\rightarrow z$

**Inductive Proof**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> *Standard Formation:*
>
> 1. Find an exact element has this property
> 2. suppose the $k^{th}$ element has this property
> 3. prove that the  $(k+1)^{th}$ element has this property

**Recursive Definition**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> *Standard Formation:*
>
> 1. Define the start of the sequence
> 2. Then give the function that the input will contain the former elements and the output will be just the next element of the sequence

**Proof by Contradiction**

First assume the proposition to be right, then find the contradiction.

**Proposition**

A declarative sentence that can be judged as either true or false.

A proposition that does not contain any smaller part that is still a proposition is called an **atomic proposition**.

A proposition that involves the assembly of multiple propositions is called a **compound proposition**.

**logical connective**

*Definition: Words that connect multiple propositions to form a compound proposition.*

**General Rules in Language**

1. Syntax

   Having the valid grammar.

2. Semantics

   Having Correct Meaning
