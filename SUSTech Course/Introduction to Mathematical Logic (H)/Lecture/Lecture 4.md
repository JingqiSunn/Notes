**Segment**

when u=$w_1$v$w_2$ ,when all of them are expressions, so we will have u is a segment.

**Proper Segment**

when v and u are not the same.

**Initial/Terminal Segment**

u=v$\times$w.

v is the prefix, and it will has more opening brackets than the closing brackets.

vis versa.

proper prefix or suffix are both not the proper formula in the expression.
